PROBLEM:

Write a query identifying the type of each record in the TRIANGLES table using its three side lengths. Output one of the following statements for each record in the table:

Equilateral: It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.
Isosceles: It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.
Scalene: It's a triangle with  sides of differing lengths.
Not A Triangle: The given values of A, B, and C don't form a triangle.


SOLUTION:

select(case when (a+b<=c) or (b+c<=c) or (a+c<=b) then 'Not A Triangle'
       when (a=b) and (b=c) then 'Equilateral'
       when (a=b) or (b=c)or (a=c) then 'Isosceles'
       else 'Scalene' end)
    from triangles
